and analyze privacy policies with ease.

## üöÄ Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses advanced language models to extract key information from privacy policies
- **Comprehensive Scoring**: Evaluates privacy policies across multiple dimensions
- **Easy Integration**: Simple Python API for seamless integration into your workflow
- **Web Scraping**: Automatically extracts privacy policy content from websites
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching system for improved performance

## üéØ What It Does

The Privacy Policy Analyzer helps you:

- **Extract Key Information**: Automatically identify data collection practices, sharing policies,
  and user rights
- **Score Privacy Policies**: Get quantitative scores on various privacy aspects
- **Compare Policies**: Analyze multiple privacy policies side by side
- **Generate Reports**: Create detailed analysis reports for stakeholders

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HappyHackingSpace/privacy-policy.git
cd privacy-policy

# Using uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or using pip
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
# Analyze a homepage URL ‚Äî auto-discovery will attempt to resolve a policy page
python -m src.main --url "https://example.com"

# Analyze a known policy URL directly
python -m src.main --url "https://example.com/privacy-policy" --no-discover
```

## üìä Analysis Dimensions

The analyzer evaluates privacy policies across ten key dimensions.  
Each dimension is scored on a **0‚Äì10 scale**, then combined with weights to produce a final **0‚Äì100 overall score**.

- **Lawful Basis & Purpose**: Whether the policy explains clear purposes for processing and, where relevant, the legal basis or justification.  
- **Collection & Minimization**: How clearly the policy describes the types of data collected and whether collection is limited to what is necessary.  
- **Secondary Use & Limits**: Whether the policy restricts or explains additional uses beyond the original purpose.  
- **Retention & Deletion**: Clarity on how long data is kept, deletion practices, or criteria for determining retention.  
- **Third Parties & Processors**: Disclosure of processors, vendors, or third parties with whom data is shared, and their roles.  
- **Cross-Border Transfers**: Information on transfers outside the user‚Äôs country/region and safeguards in place.  
- **User Rights & Redress**: How users can exercise rights such as access, correction, deletion, or complaint, and available escalation channels.  
- **Security & Breach**: Security measures described and any statements about breach notification or handling.  
- **Transparency & Notice**: Overall clarity, structure, contact details, and how users are informed of updates or changes.  
- **Sensitive Data, Children, Ads & Profiling**: How sensitive categories are handled, rules for children‚Äôs data, use of data for advertising, and automated decision-making/profiling.

## üîß Advanced Features

- **Flexible Fetching**: Choose between `auto`, `http`, or `selenium` modes.  
- **Configurable Chunking**: Control `--chunk-size`, `--chunk-overlap`, and `--max-chunks` for long policies.  
- **Multiple Report Levels**: Select `summary`, `detailed`, or `full` output.  
- **Model Override**: Use `--model` or the `OPENAI_MODEL` environment variable to select your OpenAI model.
