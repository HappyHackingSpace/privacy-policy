# Privacy Policy Analyzer

Privacy Policy Analyzer is a Python-based tool that extracts privacy policies from websites and evaluates their security using OpenAI's GPT-4. The program analyzes how user data is collected, used, stored, and shared, assigning a security score between 0 and 100.

By automating the assessment process, the tool helps users identify potential risks in data handling practices and provides insights into the transparency and reliability of privacy policies. It enables businesses, researchers, and privacy-conscious individuals to quickly evaluate websites' data protection measures.
